    <h3>This is my awesome bio!</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Columbus, Ohio. Shortly after my family moved to Venezuela where I lived most of my life. While
      growing up I started playing different kinds of video games to which it slowly made me be more curious of how each
      component on a software level on computers and consoles worked.
      While studying Civil Engineering in Venezuela, I was met with C++ and that made it easy to find out that software
      development was my calling. After moving back to Columbus, I joined the USArmy where I served six years. Once I
      finished my contract I was in the lookout for a job and found We Can Code IT bootcamp where i became a
      software developer. My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, and travelling.</p>
