    <h3 class="bio__header">Let me share a little bit of myself!</h3>
    <p class="solid">
      I was born in Columbus, Ohio. Shortly after my family moved to Venezuela where I lived most of my life.
      While
      growing up I started playing different kinds of video games to which it slowly made me be more curious of
      how
      each
      component on a software level on computers and consoles worked.
      While studying Civil Engineering in Venezuela, I was met with C++ and that made it easy to find out that
      software
      development was my calling. After moving back to Columbus, I joined the USArmy where I served six years.
      Once I
      finished my contract I was in the lookout for a job and found We Can Code IT bootcamp where i became a
      software developer. My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, and travelling.</p>
