  <h3>This is my awesome bio!</h3>
  <p>
    I was born in Columbus, Ohio. Shortly after my family moved to Venezuela where I lived most of my life. While
    growing up I started playing different kinds of video games to which it slowly made me be more curious of how each
    component on a software level on computers and consoles worked.
    While studying Civil Engineering in Venezuela, I was met with C++ and that made it easy to find out that software
    development was my calling. After moving back to Columbus, I joined the USArmy where I served six years.</p>
  <p>
    Once I finished my contract I was in the lookout for a job and found We Can Code IT bootcamp where i became a
    software developer. My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, and travelling.</p>
